# EK210-Cell-Microscopy-Chamber
This repository contains the code used in my EK210 - Introduction to Engineering Design final project. In this project, my group and I were able to create a Six-Chamber Cell Microscopy chamber, which was able to remain between 35-36 degrees celcius and 95-98% humidity for over 90 minutes without changing. The code provided was ran by using Arduino, and allowed for these constrained to be accurately maintained. The collaborators on the project are as follows
  - Carrie Li
  - Yong Ng
  - Fernando Ortiz
  - Christopher Ayala-Bellido(Myself)
